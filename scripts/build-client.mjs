/**
 * Build the browser half with esbuild.
 *
 * The shell's client manifest fetches exactly ONE script per bundle
 * (`/plugins/<id>/client.js`), loaded as a plain `<script>` — no import graph,
 * no `type="module"`, nothing behind a second URL. So the browser half can be
 * ordinary modules at source level but must collapse into one CJS-shaped
 * factory body at emit time, requiring only the ids the shell seeds into its
 * module table.
 *
 * Two steps, mirroring the host half's separation of check and emit:
 *
 *   1. `tsc -p src/client/tsconfig.json` typechecks the browser modules (no
 *      emit) — their imports resolve against the structural views in
 *      `src/client/shell-modules.d.ts` plus the DOM lib;
 *   2. this script runs esbuild over `src/client/index.ts`: bundle, CJS
 *      output, `platform: "neutral"` (no Node or DOM globals assumed), the
 *      baseline ids kept external, and an external source map so the emitted
 *      bundle is debuggable back to `src/client/*.ts`.
 *
 * One deviation from the reference build stays visible here: the reference
 * inlines `*.module.css` files through a CSS-modules plugin. This plugin's
 * DOM checks are structural — `cls.contains("dhi-twrap")` and the
 * `[data-hi-session] [data-hi-title]` rule must read the literal names — so
 * hashing the class names would break both checks and the injected-CSS
 * contract. The sheets therefore travel as TS strings under `src/client/styles/`,
 * injected DOM-checked per document.
 *
 * The bundle's shape is the loader's contract, not esbuild's: the factory
 * prologue/epilogue is supplied through esbuild's `banner`/`footer`, so the
 * generated body sits inside
 * `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory: (require) => … })` exactly as
 * every other plugin's emitted half does.
